<h1>Rules and information</h1>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">To make the competition fair we have added some rules:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>You need a user account on Strava to participate www.strava.com</li>
        <li>You need to join your local club on Strava to participate</li>
        <li>If it is not on Strava, it did not happen</li>
        <li>Cheating is not allowed</li>
        <li>Participating is voluntary, but by joining the club you accept that your results are a part of the competition and will be shared with Omega to be presented as a part of the accumulated total</li>
        <li>You are responsible for your personal settings on the app and what you share with others.</li>
    </ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">Each week the accumulated kilometres for each club will be added up and then divided by the size of the office/location headcount. <br>The club with the highest median will be declared a winner by the competition committee. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Running is a high impact & cardio activity and therefore induces more stress than cycling and  fairness we will be using a ratio for cycling due to the amount of kilometres that can be easily covered compared to running and other activities; <b>for each 3km cycled = 1km run.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once the winning club has been disclosed the committee will do a random draw between the club participants to select the lucky winner of the weekly prize.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Weekly prize:</b> Suunto 9 Barometer sports watch with Nordic inside!</u></p>


<h2>Current issues</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    The leaderboard runs a pythonscript at most once an hour, where it retreieves the activities listed under "Last activites" for each club. The activites are parsed through a loop where depending on the activity, the distance is adjusted according to the ratios above before beeing added to the weekly total.<br><br>
    The Strava API only returns the activities with registered time/date <b>after</b> the last update.Therefore, if an activity is registered with date/time earlier than the last update, it will not be retrieved by the Strava API. We will do our best to adjust for this regularly.<br><br>
    Because the API only returns activites visible under the "Last Activities" tab, activities registered as viewable "only by you" is impossible to count.<br><br>
    <b>Latest manual correction:</b> 11.02.21, 18:30
</p>

<h2>Information about the leaderboard</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    The leaderboard uses Strava's own API to collect the participating clubs activity. <br>No personal data is stored or processed.<br>The weeks end each sunday at 23:59 GMT+1. <br>For questions & sugestions contact <a href="mailto:andrsba@stud.ntnu.no?Subject=Stravaleaderboard" class="hover">andrsba@stud.ntnu.no</a>
